# Dimeji.NasVille_Data_Cleaning
# Data Cleaning Portfolio Project

## Overview

This repository contains a data cleaning portfolio project, where I demonstrate my skills in cleaning and preparing datasets for analysis using SQL. The project focuses on data related to housing in Nashville, Tennessee. The dataset includes information on sales dates, property addresses, owner names, owner addresses, and more.

## Data Source

The dataset used for this project was obtained from the (https://github.com/AlexTheAnalyst/PortfolioProjects), and it provides comprehensive records of housing transactions in Nashville.

## Data Cleaning Process

The data cleaning process includes the following steps, all performed using SQL:

1. **Data Assessment**: I conduct an initial assessment of the dataset using SQL queries to identify data quality issues, missing values, and duplicates.

2. **Handling Missing Values**: I use SQL to explore strategies for dealing with missing data, such as imputation or removal, based on the nature and impact of missing values.

3. **Dealing with Duplicates**: I identify and remove any duplicate records from the dataset using SQL to ensure data integrity.

4. **Data Transformation**: I apply necessary transformations, such as converting data types or creating new features, using SQL to make the data suitable for analysis.

5. **Validation**: I verify the results of data cleaning using SQL queries to ensure accuracy and consistency.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- `data/`: Contains the raw dataset on housing in Nashville.
- `queries/`: SQL scripts used for data cleaning and transformation steps.
- `results/`: Visualizations and summary reports generated from the cleaned data.
- `README.md`: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Getting Started

To reproduce the data cleaning process or explore the cleaned dataset, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Access the SQL scripts in the `queries/` directory for the step-by-step data cleaning process.
3. Find the cleaned dataset and visualizations in the `results/` directory.
